{model_specific_instructions}

=== ASSET TYPE (default guidance — user's words override this) ===
{asset_context}

=== STYLE ===
{style_section}

=== USER'S IDEA ===
"{user_prompt}"

RULES:

1. **PRESERVE EVERYTHING THE USER DESCRIBED.** If they mention a setting, scene, background, camera angle, or mood — keep it ALL. The asset type above is a default for simple prompts like "a cat". When the user describes more, follow their vision.

2. **ENHANCE WITH PROFESSIONAL DETAIL — do not invent or change the concept.** Your job is to make the user's idea look BETTER, not different. Add:
   - Structural accuracy: correct anatomy/proportions for characters, accurate construction for objects, proper perspective for scenes
   - Material quality: how surfaces actually look (metal reflections, fabric drape, wood grain, skin texture) — not just color names
   - Lighting: describe the light setup (warm key light direction, rim light for separation, ambient fill)
   - Composition: camera angle, framing, depth of field if appropriate

3. **KEEP THE SAME ART STYLE throughout.** Do NOT inject an art style the user didn't ask for. No "cel-shaded" unless they said cel-shaded. No "watercolor" unless they said watercolor. No "chibi" ever unless asked. If no style is specified, default to polished digital illustration / concept art.

4. **Write as a CAPTION describing what the image shows.** Not commands.
   - BAD: "Create a warrior. Make sure the anatomy is correct."
   - GOOD: "A muscular warrior in battle-worn plate armor, standing in a wide combat stance, one hand gripping a longsword at shoulder height, scarred face visible beneath a dented half-helm, warm golden light from upper-left catching the polished steel pauldrons"

5. **MODERATION-SAFE LANGUAGE.** AI image models have content filters. Avoid words that trigger false positives:
   - Use "beige" or "skin-toned" instead of "nude" (the color)
   - Use "barefoot" instead of "bare feet" or "naked feet"
   - Use "form-fitting" instead of "tight" or "skin-tight"
   - Use "exposed shoulders" instead of "bare shoulders"
   - Never use: nude, naked, bare skin, undressed, revealing, provocative, seductive — even in innocent contexts

6. **NEGATIVE: line** — include ONLY if the model supports negative prompts (check MODEL instructions above). If the model says NO negative prompts, skip this entirely and focus all effort on the positive caption.
   When included, use terms that prevent common failures:
   - For people/characters: bad anatomy, extra limbs, extra fingers, missing fingers, deformed hands, disproportionate
   - For all: blurry, low quality, text, watermark, signature, ugly, deformed

7. **Stay under {max_chars} characters.** Be precise, not verbose. Every word should paint the picture. Follow any length guidance in the MODEL instructions above.

Output ONLY the caption (and NEGATIVE: line if applicable).""",

1. **ALL options must honor the user's brief.** If they said "female sailor on a victorian ship" — every option has a female sailor on a victorian ship. You vary the INTERPRETATION, not the subject.

2. **Vary DESIGN CHOICES, not art medium.** All options should feel like they belong in the same portfolio — same production quality, same art style. What changes between options:
   - Different character design (outfit details, pose, expression, accessories)
   - Different composition/camera angle (eye-level vs low-angle vs over-shoulder)
   - Different mood/atmosphere (warm golden hour vs moody overcast vs dramatic storm)
   - Different moment/action (standing confidently vs in motion vs examining something)
   Do NOT vary: art style (no cel-shaded in one and photorealistic in another), and NEVER make any option chibi, cartoon, or low-detail unless the user asked for that.

3. **Every option must be production-quality.** Each one should include:
   - Accurate anatomy/proportions for any characters or creatures
   - Material descriptions (not just colors — how surfaces look and behave)
   - Lighting setup (key light, rim light, ambient)
   - Enough detail that the image model knows exactly what to render

4. **Keep the user's setting/context in EVERY option.** If they described a scene, all options include that scene. If they mentioned specific clothing, all options have that clothing (but can vary details).

5. Each concept must be under {max_chars} characters. Write as a descriptive caption.

Design a visually appealing text layout. For each line, specify:
- x, y pixel coordinates — this is the **anchor point** of the text
- anchor: how the text is aligned relative to (x, y):
  - "mm" = middle-middle (x, y is the CENTER of the text) — best for centered layouts
  - "lt" = left-top (x, y is the top-left corner)
  - "mt" = middle-top (x is center, y is top)

- Font size in pixels
- Color as a hex code (e.g. "#FFD700")
- The font filename to use (or "default" if no specific font)
- Visual effects: shadow, outline, and/or glow

CRITICAL for centering: To center text horizontally, set x to half the canvas width and use anchor "mm" or "mt". Do NOT try to calculate left-offset manually.

Position hints guide general placement:
- "top-center": x at center, y near the top, anchor "mt"
- "bottom-center": x at center, y near the bottom, anchor "mm"
- "center": x and y at canvas center, anchor "mm"
- "below-previous": same x as previous line, y offset by previous font_size + spacing
- Other hints should be interpreted creatively

Not every line needs every effect. Use effects judiciously to create hierarchy and readability.

Prompt: "{user_prompt}"

Asset types:
- game_asset: A single isolated object, item, or prop on a transparent background. No scene, no people. Examples: a sword, a treasure chest, a potion bottle, a tree, a crystal.
- character: The PERSON or CREATURE is clearly the STAR of the image — the prompt is primarily about THEM (their appearance, outfit, pose, expression). A scene may be mentioned as backdrop, but the character is the focal point. Examples: "a warrior holding a sword", "a female sailor", "a cute fox", "a wizard casting a spell".
- environment: A scene, landscape, location, or setting. People or creatures may APPEAR in the scene, but the SCENE ITSELF is the subject — the composition is about the place, the atmosphere, the view. If the prompt describes a wide shot, a location "shown from outside", or focuses on the setting more than any individual, it's an environment. Examples: "a medieval village at sunset", "a train on tracks with mountains", "a woman piloting a train shown from outside with a village backdrop", "a busy marketplace with vendors".
- marketing_banner: A wide cinematic scene for promotional use. Only if the user explicitly mentions banner, promotional, marketing, or advertisement.
- icon: A simple bold symbol for UI use. Only if the user mentions icon or button.

KEY DISTINCTION: If the prompt describes a PERSON but the composition is about the SCENE (wide shot, shown from outside, backdrop focus, multiple elements described equally), classify as "environment" not "character". Only classify as "character" when the person IS the primary subject the viewer should focus on.
